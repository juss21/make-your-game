### Good to know
> if you are unable to squish some of the creatures, try another browser or zoom out/in a little and see if that fixes it. (100% chrome and/or 90% firefox - seems to be working for most)    

> if you are encountering any performance issues, try playing the game in incognito. Sometimes the browser addons might cause issues    

> if you are annoyed by the theme song of the game, you can disable it in the settings. The settings are available in game. (Your setting will be remembered)   

> in short if you are encountering any issues, feel free to let us know
