### Game is being hosted [HERE](http://joelsoft.eu:1111/) with a public scoreboard.

To run the project on your own computer, you can do so with golang `go run .`

The game has similarities with 2 well known games, Super Mario & Space Invaders 

*** SPOILERS !!! *** 
The Game itself has 3 levels. To get score you must jump on the enemies and pass the levels, without dying.
The last map contains a boss fight where you have to collect ammo and shoot down the dragon.
Be warned, dying or missing a shot will cost you 100 score!!!
